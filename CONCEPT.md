## 0. The Science: Centrosome Maturation State as a Division History Marker

### Central Hypothesis

> **The mother centrosome carries a distinct maturation state. Two parallel pathways may transduce this asymmetry: (1) Cenexin→Plk1→γ-tubulin→spindle asymmetry→daughter cell size (Thomas & Meraldi 2024, PMID 39012627, human RPE1/MCF10A, 3.1% asymmetry); (2) centrosomal concentration of phospho-β-catenin targeted for degradation→asymmetric inheritance→differential Wnt signalling (Fuentealba et al. 2008, PMID 18511557 — demonstrated in human ESC and Cos7 cells: p-β-catenin and polyubiquitinated proteins asymmetrically segregate via the centrosome in mammalian mitosis).**
>
> **🔴 CRITICAL: Thomas & Meraldi showed SPINDLE asymmetry (3.1%) in human cells — but the authors themselves noted "the functional significance is unclear." Fuentealba showed CENTROSOMAL ASYMMETRIC SEGREGATION in human cells. Neither tested FATE. ARGUS-LP_OS is the FIRST direct test of whether these mechanisms produce biologically meaningful fate divergence. We do not assume. We measure.**
>
> **Competitive landscape:** Meraldi Lab (U Geneva) demonstrated the 3.1% mechanism but has not published fate consequences. Jessberger Lab (U Zurich, Royall 2023) showed centrosome→fate in organoid NPCs but not in single-cell time-lapse. Tsukita Lab (Odf2 domains) provides the genetic tools. ARGUS-LP_OS bridges all three: single-cell time-lapse resolution + fate readout + open platform at $24K.

### 0.1. Two Fluorescent Probes, Two Tasks

> **🔴 CRITICAL DISTINCTION — Centrin1-GFP and Cenexin antibody serve DIFFERENT purposes:**

| Probe | When | Task |
|-------|------|------|
| **Centrin1-GFP** | Live, every frame | **TRACKING** — where are the centrioles? Which cell inherited which centrosome? Follow positions through mitosis. |
| **Cenexin antibody** | Endpoint (72h, fixed) | **CLASSIFICATION** — which centrosome was the mature mother? Cenexin-bright = old. |

**Centrin1-GFP does NOT need to report centriole age.** It only needs to show POSITIONS. The age assignment is done retrospectively at endpoint with Cenexin antibody — the gold standard used by Anderson & Stearns 2009. Pilot 1 validates that Centrin1-GFP tracking is concordant with Cenexin classification (target: ≥90% concordance).

### 0.2. Maturation State Definition

> **Maturation state is operationally defined as the Cenexin fluorescence intensity ratio: _M = I(Cenexin)ᵃ / I(Cenexin)ᵇ_.** _M_ is a continuous variable in all primary analyses. A binary threshold (_M > 1.5_) is calibrated via ROC analysis in Pilot 1.
>
> **⚠️ Mitosis caveat:** Distal/subdistal appendages partially disassemble during mitosis (reviewer comment on Thomas & Meraldi 2024). Cenexin staining intensity may fluctuate through the cell cycle. Pilot 1 validates Cenexin signal at different cell cycle stages (interphase, prophase, metaphase, telophase) in synchronized RPE1 cells. If Cenexin intensity varies >20% across cell cycle → use Ninein as secondary marker (Royall 2023 validated Ninein for NPCs).

### 0.3. Alternative Hypotheses

| Scenario | Prediction | Precedent | Action if confirmed |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **A: Mother → stemness** | Mature mother → progenitor | Wang 2009 (PMID 19829375); Royall 2023 (PMID 37882444) | Compare with Royall 2023. |
| **B: Daughter → stemness** | Immature daughter → progenitor | Conduit & Raff 2010 (PMID 21145745) | Compare with Conduit 2010. |
| **C: No correlation** | Centrosome age ≠ fate | Chatterjee 2018 (PMID 29663194) — cerebellar GNPs only (tissue-specific null) | Publish null. |
| **D: Tissue polarity reversal** | Daughter → stem (Drosophila NB), Mother → differentiating | Januschke et al. 2011 (PMID 21407209) — Nature Communications | Tissue/species-specific mechanisms. ARGUS enables cross-tissue comparison. |

> **Key insight:** The centrosome-fate relationship is **tissue- and species-specific.** Drosophila NB: daughter→stem (Januschke 2011). Mammalian glia: mother→stem (Wang 2009). Human NPC organoids: mother→self-renewal (Royall 2023). CD8+ T cells: mother→effector (Barandun 2025). There is NO universal rule. ARGUS-LP_OS provides the first platform to systematically measure this across cell types.

### 0.4. Three Hypotheses

> **H₁ (Platform — PRIMARY):** ARGUS-LP_OS can maintain continuous 72-hour operation inside a glove-box enclosure with <5 µm focus drift per 24h, ≥95% cell retention on CYTOO islands, automated mitosis detection, and ≥90% concordance between Centrin1-GFP live tracking and Cenexin endpoint classification. **H₁ is a standalone result — the first open-source centrosome-aware lineage tracking platform with night vision and glove-box at $24K.**
>
> **H₂ (Biology — SECONDARY):** In RPE1-hTERT, the daughter cell inheriting the mature mother centrosome (higher _M_) forms a primary cilium significantly earlier than its sister (shorter time-to-ciliogenesis), after controlling for cell size.
>
> **H₃ (Fate — TERTIARY, NPCs):** In hTERT-NPCs, mature mother centrosome inheritance → higher probability of maintaining progenitor identity (Nestin⁺/Sox2⁺) vs. differentiation (Tuj1⁺/GFAP⁺).
>
> H₁ validates the instrument. H₂ is the biological discovery in RPE1. H₃ extends to a fate-relevant model. **If H₁ fails, H₂ and H₃ are uninterpretable.** The platform must work before biology can be tested.

### 0.5. Two Molecular Pathways (Mechanism)

> Centrosome maturation state may influence daughter cell behavior through two non-mutually-exclusive pathways, both demonstrated in human cells:
>
> **Pathway A — Spindle asymmetry (Thomas & Meraldi 2024, PMID 39012627):** Cenexin → Plk1 → pericentrin/γ-tubulin/Cdk5Rap2 → 3.1% spindle length asymmetry → daughter cell size difference → differential cilium assembly kinetics. Demonstrated in human RPE1 and MCF10A cells.
>
> **Pathway B — Asymmetric protein degradation (Fuentealba et al. 2008, PMID 18511557):** Mother centrosome concentrates phospho-β-catenin and polyubiquitinated proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation → asymmetric inheritance of degradation-targeted proteins → differential Wnt/β-catenin signalling → divergent transcriptional programs. Demonstrated in human embryonic stem cells, Cos7, and Drosophila embryos. This is the first direct demonstration of centrosome→transcription coupling in mammalian asymmetric division.
>
> Both pathways predict the same observable: daughter inheriting the mature mother centrosome behaves differently. ARGUS-LP_OS measures the output. Phase 2 (Odf2 KO with domain deletions) dissects which pathway dominates.

### 0.6. Model System Clarification

> **RPE1-hTERT** is an epithelial cell line used for **platform validation** and **cilium kinetics** (H₂). RPE1 does not undergo asymmetric fate-determining divisions — cilium formation is a cell cycle response (G1→G0), not a terminal fate decision. H₂ measures whether centrosome age predicts **timing of cilium assembly**, a quantitative, objectively measurable phenotype with a known baseline (Anderson & Stearns 2009: 94% asymmetric cilium growth).
>
> **hTERT-NPCs** are the **fate model** (H₃). Royall 2023 demonstrated that in human NPCs, mother centrosome → self-renewal via Ninein. H₃ measures whether centrosome age predicts **progenitor maintenance vs. differentiation** (Nestin/Sox2 → Tuj1/GFAP).
>
> This two-tier design separates **platform validation** (RPE1 — directly literature-supported) from **biological discovery** (NPCs — requires methodological validation).

## 1. Controls and Confounds

| Confound | Control |
|----------|---------|
| Centrin1-GFP/H2B-GFP may alter centrosome/cell cycle | Untagged RPE1 vs. GFP-RPE1: compare cilium kinetics in Pilot 1. Δ>10% → use lower-expression clone |
| IR 850 nm prolonged exposure (72h) — phototoxicity, heating unknown | IR-ON vs. IR-OFF arms in Pilot 0. Measure viability + temperature probe in medium (ΔT<0.5°C). Use pulsed mode (1s every 5 min) if continuous IR heats >0.5°C |
| Water immersion objective evaporation → focus drift | Automated water dispenser + saturated humidity in glove-box. Monitor focus drift with GFP beads |
| Cenexin appendages disassemble during mitosis | Pilot 1: Cenexin IF at interphase/prophase/metaphase/telophase in synchronized cells. If >20% variation → add Ninein co-stain |
| LED 488 nm phototoxicity (≤200 ms, ≤5% power) | Dark control (no LED) vs. LED protocol. Viability ≥90% in Pilot 1 |
| Serum starvation effects on biology | Test in Pilot 2: ±serum conditions. If serum alters M→cilium → use cycling conditions |
| CYTOO retention >48h unknown | Pilot 2: 72h test. Fallback: gridded microwell dishes |
| 3.1% spindle asymmetry biologically meaningful? | Tested by experiment: if M (continuous) does NOT predict cilium timing → 3.1% below functional threshold |

## 3. The Experiment: Sister Tracking

### 1.1. Method

| Step | Action |
|:----:|--------|
| 1 | RPE1-hTERT Centrin1-GFP + H2B-GFP divide inside glove-box |
| 2 | **Live tracking:** Centrin1-GFP follows centriole POSITIONS through mitosis |
| 3 | Sisters tracked on CYTOO 2-cell islands for 72h (~3 cell cycles) |
| 4 | **Lineage tree:** track mother→daughters→granddaughters→great-granddaughters |
| 5 | **Endpoint:** fix, Cenexin antibody → CLASSIFY + acetylated tubulin → cilium |
| 6 | **Primary analysis:** time-to-ciliogenesis (Kaplan-Meier, hazard ratio) as function of _M_ |
| 7 | **Secondary:** cilium presence (binary, McNemar) + Ki67 (proliferation status) |

**Lineage design:** 72h = ~3 divisions. We track the full tree: which daughter inherits the mature centrosome at each division. **Centrosome age in generations 1-2** is inferred from the mitotic trajectory (mother centrosome identified at endpoint by Cenexin intensity → backtracked through Centrin1-GFP tracking). This inference is validated by the ≥90% concordance requirement in Pilot 1. Pairs with ambiguous backtracking are flagged and analysed separately as sensitivity check.

**Mitosis detection:** H2B-GFP chromatin condensation triggers 1-2 min imaging, ensuring centriole distribution is captured at the critical moment.

**Competing risks:** Cells that divide before forming a cilium are treated as competing events (Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model, with division as the competing risk). Cells that neither divide nor form a cilium by 72h are right-censored.

**CYTOO note:** No published data on 72h micropattern culture — 72h pilot included (Pilot 2). Fallback: gridded microwell dishes. **Micropipette separation is NOT used in Phase 1** — technical risk too high for a platform-validation experiment.

### 1.2. Endpoints

| Endpoint | Type | Measurement | Analysis |
|----------|:----:|-------------|----------|
| **Time-to-ciliogenesis** | 🎯 Primary | Hours from cytokinesis to acetylated tubulin⁺ cilium ≥1 µm | Kaplan-Meier, Cox PH (hazard ratio per unit _M_) |
| Cilium presence at 72h | Secondary | Binary (yes/no) | McNemar (paired) |
| Ki67 status | Secondary | Binary (Ki67⁺/Ki67⁻) | McNemar (paired) |
| Differentiation (NPCs) | Tertiary | Nestin/Sox2 → Tuj1/GFAP | Fisher exact |

**Time-to-ciliogenesis measurement:** Cilium formation is measured in EACH cell cycle. Cells lose cilia before mitosis → reform in G1. The clock starts at cytokinesis of each division. If a cell divides before forming a cilium → competing event. Model: recurrent events (Prentice-Williams-Peterson gap-time model) stratified by cell cycle number. Primary readout: hazard ratio for cilium formation in cycle 1 (most proximal to centrosome inheritance).

### 1.3. Controls

| Group | Treatment |
|:-----:|-----------|
| Untouched | No manipulation |
| Sham | CYTOO island, no further manipulation |
| Bland-Altman | Untouched vs Sham: agreement assessed. Δ>10% → confound. |

### 1.4. Statistical Design — Formal Power Analysis

**Primary test (time-to-ciliogenesis):** Cox proportional hazards model.

```
coxph(Surv(time_to_cilium, cilium_status) ~ M + CellArea + DivisionNumber + cluster(MotherID))
```

**Secondary test (binary):** McNemar for paired binary outcome.

```
H₀: P(cilium | mature mother) = P(cilium | immature mother) = 0.5
```

**Power calculation for time-to-event:**
- For hazard ratio 1.4 (40% faster cilium in mature-mother daughters), α=0.05, β=0.2
- Events needed: ~65 cilium-positive cells
- With 70% cilium rate at 72h: N = 65/0.7 = **93 pairs**
- **With 20% attrition + ICC ρ≤0.3:** N_planned = 93/(0.8×0.77) ≈ **150 pairs**

**Target: 200 pairs with interim analysis at N=100** — detects HR ≥1.35 with 80% power. If interim HR <1.15 → increase to **N=300** (futility boundary not crossed). For HR=1.2, N=300 provides 80% power at ICC ρ=0.3. ICC estimated in Pilot 3, final N adjusted accordingly.

**Multiple testing protocol (preregistered on OSF):** Hierarchical gatekeeping for primary→secondary. (1) Primary: time-to-cilium → if p<0.05, test secondaries. (2-4) Secondaries: cilium binary, Ki67, NPC markers — Benjamini-Hochberg FDR (q<0.1) within this level. If primary p≥0.05 → all secondaries descriptive only.

**Power note:** At N=200 with ICC ρ=0.3, Fine-Gray competing risk model: actual power ~75% for HR=1.35 (not 80% as simplified Cox calculation suggests). Interim analysis at N=100: if HR<1.15 → escalate to N=300. Final N=300 provides 82% power at HR=1.35.

**Model (full):**
```
coxph(Surv(time_to_cilium, cilium_status) ~ M + CellArea + DivisionNumber + Ki67 + strata(Generation) + cluster(MotherID))
```

|:-----:|--------|:--------:|----------|
| **Pilot 0** | GFP beads, 7 days, 60×/1.2 NA | 1 week | Drift <5 µm/24h |
| **Pilot 1** | RPE1 Centrin1-GFP + Cenexin fix + phototoxicity + EdU proliferation | 3 days | Centrin-Cenexin ≥90% + viability ≥90% vs dark + Cenexin cell cycle stability + GFP vs WT proliferation (EdU) Δ<5% |
| **Pilot 2** | CYTOO islands, 72h, 10 pairs | 1 week | Cell retention ≥80% |
| **Pilot 3** | RPE1, 50 pairs | 2 weeks | Effect size for final N |
| **Main RPE1** | RPE1-hTERT, 200 pairs, lineage tree (3 gen) | 4 weeks | Primary: time-to-ciliogenesis |
| **Main NPCs** | hTERT-NPCs, 100 pairs, lineage tree (3 gen) | 4 weeks | Primary: Nestin→Tuj1/GFAP fate |

| **Phase 3 (v3.0)** | hTERT-NPCs + ExM endpoint | 6 weeks | Progenitor map |

## 5. Phase 2 (v2.0): Odf2 Domain Deletions — Causality

Odf2 KO causes severe defects in distal/subdistal appendages and blocks ciliogenesis (Ishikawa 2005, PMID 15852003 — mouse F9 cells).
- aa 188-806 → transition fibers/distal appendages (DA). Deletion → DA+SA− (distal present, subdistal absent). Cilia form but are abnormal.
- aa 1-59 (N-terminal) → centriole recruitment. Deletion → no localization, no appendages, no cilia.
- C-terminal domain → appendage formation after recruitment. Deletion → centrosome binding intact, appendages absent.

**Experimental design (domain deletions, validated per Tateishi 2013):**

| Group | Construct | Tateishi 2013 phenotype | Prediction for ARGUS |
|:-----:|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| WT | — | Normal appendages + cilia | 94% asymmetry (baseline) |
| Odf2⁻/⁻ | — | No appendages, no cilia | No cilia, no asymmetry |
| **Odf2⁻/⁻ + Odf2(FL)** | Full-length Odf2-GFP | Full rescue: DA+SA+, cilia+ | **Positive control.** Appendages + cilia restored → asymmetry restored |
| **Odf2⁻/⁻ + Odf2(Δ188-806)** | Central domain deletion | **DA+SA−.** Distal appendages present, subdistal absent. Cilia form but are abnormal (reduced frequency, shorter) | **Key experimental group.** Tests whether distal appendages ALONE sufficient for centrosome-age-dependent asymmetry |
| **Odf2⁻/⁻ + Odf2(Δ1-59)** | N-terminal deletion | **No centriole recruitment.** Does NOT localize to basal bodies. No appendages, no cilia | **Negative control.** Confirms recruitment is required |
| **Odf2⁻/⁻ + Odf2(ΔC)** | C-terminal deletion | Centrosome binding intact, but NO appendage formation | **Pharmacological control.** Separates centrosome binding from appendage function |

**Why this replaces HDAC6i:** Wang 2025 (PMID 40167251) is a review — no experimental data on Odf2⁻/⁻ rescue. PubMed search: 0 results for HDAC6i+Odf2 KO. Tateishi 2013 provides validated domain-level resolution. **Risk:** Tateishi used mouse F9 cells. Human RPE1 Odf2 constructs must be validated — this is a separate engineering task (6-8 weeks).

**Centrosome age determination in Odf2-KO:** Without Cenexin/Odf2, the standard age marker is absent. Alternative: **Ninein** (subdistal appendage protein, validated in Royall 2023 for NPCs) or **Centrin1-GFP tracking** (trajectory-based inference from last Cenexin-positive division). Pilot experiments will validate Ninein as age proxy in Odf2-KO RPE1.

## 6. Optical Design

| Objective | Resolution | Centriole gap at MITOSIS (>5 µm) | Cost |
|-----------|:----------:|:-------------------------------:|:----:|
| **60×/1.2 NA WI** | ~248 nm | ✅ Easily resolved | $3,000 |

**Cenexin calibration:** FITC calibration beads (Spherotech, 2.5 µm) imaged in each experiment. Cenexin intensity normalized to bead fluorescence → cross-experiment comparable _M_. Threshold calibrated via ROC in Pilot 1.

**Phase 3 (v2.0) option:** Expansion microscopy (ExM, ~4× physical expansion) for super-resolved endpoint centriole analysis. 10+ PMIDs confirm ExM for centrioles.
